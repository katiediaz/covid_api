# Covid-19 Tracker
the question I aimed to answer for this project was:
How many global cases, deaths, and recoveries of Covid-19 are there currently? 
This application uses 3rd party data for disease related statistics. I chose to track the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) cases, deaths, and recoveries.  

## Requirements 
* [disease.sh API](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all)
* Requests
* Tkinter canvas 
* Datetime 

## Process
1. create a python app to show the data from the disease API 
2. import required packages for API
3. create the canvas 
4. fetch desired data from API 
5. create a jason variable 
6. create label for desired data 
7. add date and time 
8. add button to get data updates
